            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IAMES ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth Temptation; for, when he is tryed, he ſhall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him. Let no man ſay, when he is tempted, he is tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with Evil, neither tempteth he any man: But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed,</hi> James 1.12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>True Chriſtian</hi> is a Witneſs of this Saying of <hi>James,</hi> having found the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs that follows the enduring Temptation, &amp; received the Earneſt of the Crown of Life:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41137:60"/>And he truly and experimentally knoweth, That God cannot be tempted with Evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Heavenly Light and Grace, and Manifeſtation of the Holy Spirit, which he is Partaker of, and endued withal, and is of God, cannot be tempted with Evil, nor be prevailed upon to conſent or take Pleaſure in any Unrighteouſneſs; and this good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Gift of God, which cannot be tempted with Evil, nor tempteth no man, <hi>received, believed in,</hi> and <hi>entertained in the Heart,</hi> is that which enabled the Righteous in all Ages to endure Temptation, and doth enable them in this Age:
<note place="margin">☞</note> And all thoſe that know not, receive not, believe not in this Good and Perfect
<note n="*" place="margin">Which is the Light and Grace, or Holy Spirit Within.</note> Gift of God, given and ſent into the World (to Sinners as well as Saints) they cannot, nor are not able to endure Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but are led away of their Luſts, and enticed, and fall into Temptation, for want of Faith in the Gift and Power of God, which is as near them as the Temptation, and able and ready to deliver them, if they would regard it and obey it.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41137:60"/>
               <p> Now, the Ground of all Temptations are <hi>within,</hi> the Luſts that lead away, are <hi>within;</hi> the Light which diſcovers them, and the Grace which is ſufficient, and the Spirit which mortifies the Luſts,
<note place="margin">☞</note> muſt be alſo known <hi>within,</hi> where the Temptations riſe and attend Mankind (<hi>even the Righteous</hi> for a time) and divers outward Objects alſo may preſent, in order to draw out and alure the Mind to joyn with them, and to entertain them:
<note n="¶" place="margin">The Devil hath Power to Tempt, but not to Force.</note> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Temptations Within nor Without can prevail, until the Light is diſregarded, the Appearance of Grace ſleighted, and the Spirit of God deſpiſed, and the Mind joyned to the Tempter and Temptation.</p>
               <p>Now, its no Sin to be tempted, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Temptation. No man was ever condemned becauſe tempted, or becauſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Motions &amp; Temptations did ariſe in him, and preſent themſelves, if he entered not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, nor gave no place to them, nor joyned with them in his Mind, nor ſuffered his Members to obey them; but kept in the Light, Grace and Spirit of God, by which he reſiſted them, and the Author of them,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41137:61"/>and made him flee: This is the Bleſſed Man, that endureth Temptations.</p>
               <p>So though Temptations are Evil and Sinful in themſelves, and did at ſome times attend the Righteous in all Ages, and do at this day; yet if they give no place nor Conſent to them,
<note place="margin">☞</note> nor obey them, but by the Light and Spirit of God judge them, and walk in the Light which diſcovers them, and the Evil Tendency of them, and are preſerved from joyning to them, they are no Sinners becauſe tempted; as for inſtance (to ſpeak but to a low State) if any are troubled with unclean and vain Thoughts, and tempted with Dark Unlawful Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, which in themſelves are Evil and

<note place="margin">☞</note> if theſe Members are not yielded up to ſerve and obey theſe Temptations, thoſe ſo tempted are no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors; but are Witneſſes of that Prayer, and the Effect of it, which Chriſt taught his Diſciples, <hi>Lead us not,</hi> or, <hi>let us not be led into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt Jeſus was attended with divers great Temptations, and the Old Serpent (that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>) was very bold with him, and carried him from

               <p>THe <hi>True Chriſtian</hi> is endued with a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit of Diſcerning, by which he ſeeth to the Beginning, before Sin enter'd the World, and by it perceiveth, how it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and how it hath grown and encreaſed, and filled the Earth with Violence; and how that Old Serpent (which at firſt was fain to uſe great <hi>Subtilty</hi> and <hi>Lyes,</hi> and make great Promiſes, before he could prevail againſt <hi>Eve</hi>) is now grown ſo Power ful a Prince in his Kingdom of Darkneſs in the Hearts of the Children of Men, in whom he rules, that he no ſooner moves in their Hearts,
<note place="margin">☞</note> but they follow him; no ſooner commands, but they obey: he needs not uſe his Subtilty and Cunning to betray, allure and perſwade, nor make great Promiſes, before he can win to his Obedience, many being grown ſuch Natural Children of him, and ſuch born Slaves in his Kingdom, that now in theſe dayes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41137:67"/>his Commands are ſufficient to Thouſands and Ten Thouſands; and his very Motions to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil have gain'd ſuch a Powerful Name in the World, even among the <hi>Titular Chriſtians,</hi> that they count them too Mighty to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, too Powerful to vanquiſh, too Strong to war with, overcome and conquer in all his Motions, Commands and Temptations, while on this ſide the Grave; hereby People are become Home-bred Slaves, and have ſold themſelves for nought, having let in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Faith that hath ſprung up in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from the True Faith, that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſiſt all the Motions of the Devil, nor diſobey all his Commands,
<note place="margin">☞</note> nor be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from all his Temptations, till the Death of their Natural Bodies, which is then too late; for, <hi>As the Tree falls, ſo it lies, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, the <hi>Titular Chriſtian</hi> will readily acknowledge and confeſs, that the Motions of the Devil are ſtrong, powerful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>with him</hi> and <hi>in him,</hi> and that thereby he is ſtirred up to Evil: But he doth not believe, that the Spirit of God is ſo nigh him, and preſent with him, moving in him againſt the Motions of the Evil One; nor that there is ſufficient Power from God given to him, to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41137:67"/>preſerve him from obeying the Motions and Temptations of the World, Fleſh and the Devil, and to move him to that which is Good, and enable him to do it. Alſo he hath no Faith in this Gift of God, but rather counts it Deluſion (and the Property of a <hi>Phanatick</hi>) to profeſs the Knowledge of the Spirit of God moving in them to ſpeak and write good Words, and do good Works; this Profeſſors and Prophane, Learned and Unlearned, make a Mock at, concluding this Operation of the Spirit is not in uſe, nor to be known in theſe dayes, nor to be expected in theſe latter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the World; as if God had left the World of Mankind to be guided wholely by the Motions of the Devil; as if there was no Law or Power in the Mind able and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to war againſt the Law and Power that is in the Members, and overcome it: Thus to believe, is the Faith of Devils, and not the Faith of God's Elect; For, the <hi>True Chriſtian</hi> in this Age (as in former Ages) is a living Witneſs of the Moving of the Spirit of God to every good Word and Work, as the Holy Men and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in former Ages did, who ſpeak as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, and as they were led and guided by the Spirit, as is teſtified in the Holy Scriptures, though made
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41137:68"/>a Mock of in this Day: And this Spirit of God accompanied the Righteous in all Ages, and always moved, led and guided them into the Way of Peace; and as they obeyed it, and abode with it,

And the Motions of the Holy Spirit are alſo the ſame, and all that obey them bring forth the Fruits thereof, and they are both manifeſted by their Fruits; the one moves to Good, the other to Evil;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41137:68"/>the one to Love and Good-will, the other to Envy and Hatred;

               </p>
               <p>Since the Vail came over Man's heart, there was never any other Way in any Age, nor is not in this Age, to come to the true Knowledg of God but by Revelation; by taking off the Vail and removing the Covering, which hides the Face of God from Man; the outward Vailes before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Face, and in the outward Temple, were a Figure of this Vail, that is ſpread over the Hearts of Men; and the rending the Vail of the Temple from top to bottom,
<note place="margin">☞</note> was a Figure of <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Sight into the Holieſt of all,</hi> or the taking away that which ſtood betwixt Man and the True Sight and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: And there is not, nor never was (ſince the Cauſe of the Vail entered) any Man upon the Face of the Earth, that came or comes to the Knowledge of God by any other Means: Men have ſought out many Inventions, and deviſed many Wayes and Means to gain the Knowledge of God,

And further, it teacheth more Spiritual and Evangelical Leſſons then <hi>Moſes</hi> did, by whom the Law came.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>True Christian</hi> not only receives this Grace, but grows in it from one Degree unto another, and witneſſeth a being ſaved by it, and a being juſtified by it, having Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of its Sufficiency when the Enemy doth aſſault, and Tryals and Temptations attend; even as <hi>Paul,</hi>

And after People have clean eſcaped from them which live in Error, and from the Pollutions of the World, they may Err again, and be polluted again, and turn like the Dog to his Vomit again, and like the Sow that was waſhed to the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the Mire again;

               <p>Now the working of outward Miracles are not of abſolute Neceſſity in the Church of Chriſt, neither doth the Gift thereof alwayes attend the Church; and we read of no outward Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought by divers primitive Apoſtles, Miniſters and Teachers, Elders and Fathers in the Church:

               <p>And I ſtill well remember, when I was a <hi>Titular Chriſtian,</hi> and a Hearer and Diſciple of that Generation, which now calls upon the <hi>True Chriſtian</hi> for <hi>Signs</hi> aad <hi>Miracles,</hi> which no <hi>Impoſtor</hi> (or <hi>falſe Chriſtian</hi> can give; they uſed then to acknowledge and preach for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That the Converſion of one Soul to God,

               <p>Now, though thou art a Believer in the Light, and a Learner of the Grace, and art travailing right on in the ſame, towards a full Enjoyment thereof, know this, That thou wilt meet with many Tryals, Exerciſes and Temptations in the Way, ſome to turn thee out of it, and others to cauſe thee to ſit down ſhort, and take up a Reſt by the way, and glory in thy former Experiences, Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Sights and Revelations, and Power over Devils, which thou haſt been endued withal; ſo, if the old Serpent cannot prevail in the one, he may in the other; envying thy Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he will try all Means againſt thee, to beguile thee, as he did <hi>Eve,</hi> tempt and alure thee out of a Heavenly Eſtate, he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet thee within and without; and when thou appeareſt before God, hewill appear alſo with Lyes and Accuſations againſt thee: Now, keep thou in the Light wherewith thou art enlightened, and in which thou haſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and lean thou upon and truſt in the Grace of God, which is ſufficient and preſent with thee, and ready and able to ſave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:41137:97"/>thee, when his Alurements and Buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings attend thee.</p>
               <p>And this Light within, in which thou haſt believed, as thou walkeſt in it, will ſhew thee the Nature and Tendency of the Bait, though covered with Golden Pretences, and the very Hook that's covered therewith: So as thou waiteſt and abideſt in this Light, in vain is the Snare laid in thy Sight, in vain are all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Devices gainſt thee, and in vain are all his variable Appearances in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and deſtroy thee, whether he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as a ſubtil Serpent, or as a Satan to accuſe (as he did <hi>Job</hi>) before God, or as a Dragon or Roaring Lyon to devour, or as an Antichriſt; or on the contrary, whether he appear as an Angel of Light, with two Horns, like a Lamb, and in Sheep's Cloathing; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41137:98"/>Father, and God become all in all; then ſhalt thou know as thou art known, and ſee as thou art ſeen; and Death ſhall be ſwallowed up in Victory, Mortality of Immortality; and there ſhall be no more Sea, Death nor Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Crying nor Pain, former things being paſt away, and all things made new; this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his Divine and Heavenly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;</hi> and thou abiding in the Light, and walking in the Spirit, wilt not only ſee but enjoy the ſame: Read <hi>Rev.</hi> 21, &amp; 22. and the Lord give thee Underſtanding more and more, and encreaſe thy Joy in believing; and ſtrengthen thy Faith and Hope, that they may be as a Truſty Shield of Defence, and as an Anchor ſure and ſtedfaſt, to preſerve thee from all Aſſaults, and from ſplitting upon a Rock or Sands, till thou arriveſt at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Eternal Reſt, and lie down in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, where thy Bread, yea, thy Daily Bread, (freſh &amp; freſh) from the Table of the Lord will be ſure, and thy Water fail not, where none can make thee afraid, where no Enemy can prevail, where no Danger of making Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Faith and a Good Conſcience is, where no Deſtroyer is, where all Tears and the Cauſe of them are wiped away, where Faith and Hope hath an End, and where the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41137:98"/>Heavenly City is, whoſe Gates ſtand alwayes open, and yet no unclean thing can enter: As thou perſevereſt in the Light, and obeyeſt and followeſt him that hath called thee out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and tranſlated thee from the groſs Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, thou wilt thereby be led to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit and poſſeſs theſe things; for, <hi>It is he that endureth to the End, that ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, tender Friend, As thou walkeſt in thy Way, the Light within, the Spirit and Grace of God within, which teacheth not only to deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, but alſo to live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godlily in this preſent World, thou art ſafe. But I do adviſe thee notwithſtanding, to take great heed, and watch diligently againſt the Enemy of thy Happineſs in all his Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and eſpecially when he appears under the Form of Truth it ſelf, with the Words of it in his Mouth, and with the very likeneſs of it; for I have ſeen him there, &amp; he has beguiled and betrayed many thereby in this Age, even ſince we were a People; and he effected it by drawing the Mind from being ſtaid upon God, waiting low in his Light, to wonder after and deſire ſomething elſe, which he made appear lovly to behold; the attaining of which, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them, would better their Condition, and encreaſe their Glory: ſo, in hope, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

               <p>And thy Holy Form of <hi>Plainneſs of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel,</hi> and thy Avoiding of <hi>Superfluity in Meats and Drinks, &amp;c.</hi> keep thou with that Holy Spirit that led thee thereto; and let not the Senſe thereof depart from thee; ſo ſhalt thou feel the Power thereof accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of thee, and working in thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that Root and Ground from whence all Superfluity of Naughtineſs did ariſe, and wholely mortifie that Spirit that delighted in theſe things.</p>
               <p>And in thy Holy Form and Manner of <hi>Meeting together,</hi> alwayes have thy Mind exerciſed in that Love and Life, Virtue and Power of the Lord, by which he touched thy Heart, and met with thee therein in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; ſo ſhalt thou enjoy more and more of his Preſence, and encreaſe in Wiſdom, Life and Strength, and all the Virtues of the Holy Spirit: And though thou haſt received an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Holy One, which is able to teach thee all things neceſſary or needful to thy Salvation; yet this will not lead thee to forſake the aſſembling of thy ſelf with the Lord's People, according to their wonted Manner, nor to forſake the Flocks of the

               <p> For, my Faith and Belief is, <hi>That if all that ever took up the Form and Profeſſion of the Truth, Light, Grace and Spiritual Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation thereof within, had ſtood firm in the ſame, and watcht againſt, ruled over, and kept out the Spirit of Enmity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, Deceit and dead Formality; and by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gift and Power, with which they were endued, had judged the Serpent in all his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, Formings and Transformings, and walked <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightly in the ſame, the Eye of the Nations had been towards us; and</hi> Yea <hi>and</hi> Nay <hi>had been of great Authority in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of</hi> England <hi>before this day; and Truth in the Inward Parts, the Law of the Spirit, the Rule of Life and Manners</hi> Within, <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of high Eſteem in the Hearts and Minds of Thouſands, more then now it is:</hi> Offences have come, and may come; but Wo to them by whom they come.</p>
